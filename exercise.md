## Coding Exercise



### Coding Exercise 1: Numbers: Simple Artithmetic

Write an experession that equals to 100.
```
4 * 25
```

### Coding Exercise 2: Quick Print Check

Use what you know about print() function and print out the phrase "Hello World". Make sure your capitalization and spacing match.
```
print ("Hello World")
```

### Coding Exercise 3: String Indexing

Write a string index that returns just the letter 'r' from 'Hello World'.
```
For example, 'Hello World'[0] return 'H'
```
You should only write one line of code for this. Do not assign a variable name to the string
```
'Hello World'[-3]
```

### Coding Exercise 4: String Slicing

Use string slicing to grab the word 'ink' from inside 'tinker'
```
For example, 'education'[3:6] return 'cat'
```
Remember that when slicing you only go up to but not including the end index.
You should only write one line of code for this. Do not assign a variable name to the string.
```
'tinker'[1:4]
```

### Coding Exercise 5: Print Formatting

Write an expression using any of the string formatting methods we have learned (except f-strings) to return the phrase 'Python rules!'

For example, these phrase both return 'I like apples':
```
'I like %s %'apples'
'I like {}'.format('apples')
```
Your solution should be entered on one line. You can not use variable names, only the strings themselves.
```
print('{} rules!'.format('Python'))
```
### Coding Exercise 6: Lists

Create a list that contrains at least one string, one integer and one float.

For example:
```
[1, 'two', 3.14159]
```
Note that the order and number of items doesn't matter.

The answer should just be one list on a single line. Don't assign a variable name to the list.

```
new_list = ['hello', 5, 5.5]
```
